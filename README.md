Learning Docker and Kubernetes

## Docker: 
Docker is a tool that helps you easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. It makes it simple to package an application with all its parts (like libraries and dependencies) and run it anywhere.

## Container:
 A container is like a lightweight, portable box that holds everything an application needs to run. It includes the app itself, libraries, configurations, and anything else it requires. Containers run the same way no matter where you are, whether it's on your computer, in the cloud, or on a server.

## Image:
 An image is like a blueprint or snapshot of a container. It contains everything needed to create a container, like the application code and settings. You can think of it as a recipe, and the container is the finished dish. You create a container from an image.

So, Docker is the tool that manages images, which are used to create containers, and containers are the ones that actually run your application!
